Overview
---
This repository contains files for Udacity - Advanced Lane Detection project work.

Initial Committ on 27th Feb 2017. 


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
•	Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
•	Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
•	Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
•	Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
•	Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
•	Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
•	Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
•	Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
