Overview
---
This repository contains files for Udacity - Advanced Lane Detection project work.

Initial Committ on 27th Feb 2017. 


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
*Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labelled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
*Optionally, we could apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to the HOG feature vector. For those first two steps, We should also normalize the features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
*Implement a sliding-window technique and use the trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
*Run the pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
*Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.





## Summary of work done 

Pl. see writeup.pdf file for details of work done. 

I used Jupyter Notebook during the development.
